# Simple BMI Calculator

## Introduction
The Simple BMI Calculator is a Python-based application designed to calculate and categorize an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a widely-used metric for understanding whether an individual's weight is healthy for their height. This project not only calculates the BMI based on the user's input but also categorizes the calculated BMI into various levels such as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese, Severely Obese, and Morbidly Obese.

Understanding one's BMI can be a crucial step in identifying potential health risks related to weight. This project aims to make BMI calculation and categorization easily accessible to everyone. It is built with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that anyone can use it to gain quick insights into their health. The project utilizes basic Python programming concepts, making it an excellent example for those learning Python or those interested in applying Python in a healthcare context.


## Problem Statement
Understanding one's BMI is an essential aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, calculating BMI manually or finding a reliable tool can be cumbersome for many individuals. There are several tools and calculators available online, but they often come with ads, require an internet connection, or do not provide a detailed categorization of the BMI value.

# The primary challenges this project aims to address are:

*Simplicity:* Most online tools are cluttered with ads or require multiple steps to get a simple BMI reading.

*Accessibility:* Many existing tools require an internet connection, making it challenging for those without reliable internet access to calculate their BMI.

*Detailed Categorization:* While some tools may provide a BMI number, they often do not offer the user an understanding of what this number means in terms of health risks.
